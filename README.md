![screenshot](./screenshots/articles.png)

This app was built following the [Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) section of the Ruby on Rails tutorial. The style was added as an extra step using Bootstrap.

This app uses two models: articles and comments, each article could have many comments. Each article has a title and a body. Each comment has the name of who write the comment and a text.
